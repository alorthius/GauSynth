**GauSynth** is a 3D reimagination pipeline composed of the recent 2D generative model [SD-XL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952), geometry reconstruction based on [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), and Super-Resolution upscaling model [Swin2SR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11345) to address the low-quality issue of the existing 3D generative models. The proposed system generalizes to various inputs, such as renderings of _digital 3D assets_ or turn-around videos of a _real-life object_.
